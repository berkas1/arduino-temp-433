# Arduino with DS18B20 and 433 MHz transceiver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/berkas1/arduino-temp-433.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/berkas1/arduino-temp-433)



Simple code for sending temperature received from famous DS18B20 over air. Simply plug everything to your Arduino and set required pins in code.

The code will send the temperature data in this format:

``` t2534# ```

which means "25.34 Â°C"
